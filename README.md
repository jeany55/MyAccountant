# MyAccountant

**MyAccountant** is a World of Warcraft addon that helps track where your money is going.

Heavily inspired by AccountantClassic, see a breakdown of income/outcome by source either by session, day, week, month, year, or all time. It currently supports all versions of WoW.

## How to contribute

### Want to add a translation?

Make a copy of [Locales/TEMPLATE.lua](Locales/TEMPLATE.lua) and make the necessary changes for your translation.

Then either open up a PR with your change, or create an issue if you're unsure how to complete a merge (and we can do it for you!)

### Want a new feature?

Create an issue describing what you would like to see.

Or, if you're feeling brave you can make the change yourself and submit a pull request!

Increasing versions in the toc is not necessary, it's done automatically as part of the release Github Action.

### **Supports all WoW versions**

MyAccountant knows which sources are unavailable in each version of WoW. This lets this addon work on Mists Classic, Vanilla, or Retail.

### **Configure your income sources**

Decide which income sources you want to track by disabling ones you aren't interested in
